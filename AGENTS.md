# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Anchor-based Solana program named `fund`. Single on-chain program, Cargo workspace, with a TypeScript app/migrations side managed via bun.

- Program ID: `5nNVyzESLk4QNQh7HgxAAwFmHnN37WUz1aCttBLwFo2e` (declared both in `programs/fund/src/lib.rs` and `Anchor.toml`'s `[programs.localnet]` — keep in sync)
- Anchor toolchain: `package_manager = "bun"` (not yarn/npm)
- Rust toolchain pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml` (1.89.0)
- Dev shell provided by Nix flake + devenv (`flake.nix`); `.envrc` loads it via direnv

## Common commands

```bash
# Build the on-chain program (.so artifact under target/deploy/)
anchor build

# Run all Rust tests (also configured as Anchor.toml's test script)
cargo test

# Run a single test
cargo test --package fund --test test_initialize -- test_initialize --exact

# Lint / format JS/TS
bun run lint
bun run lint:fix

# Nix dev shell (auto-loaded via direnv)
nix develop
```

Pre-commit hooks (via `git-hooks.nix`) run `nixfmt`, `nil`, `cargo fmt`, `prettier`, and `taplo`. Run `nix flake check` to invoke them outside a commit.

## Test architecture (important)

Tests do **not** use `anchor test`. They use [`litesvm`](https://docs.rs/litesvm) directly from Rust integration tests under `programs/fund/tests/`.

The pattern (`tests/test_initialize.rs`):

1. `include_bytes!("../../../target/deploy/fund.so")` — pulls the compiled BPF binary at compile time.
2. `LiteSVM::new()` + `svm.add_program(program_id, bytes)` — loads it into an in-memory SVM.
3. Construct an `Instruction` using the Anchor-generated `fund::instruction::*` (data) and `fund::accounts::*` (account metas) types, then send a `VersionedTransaction`.

**Consequence: `anchor build` must run before `cargo test`.** Without `target/deploy/fund.so`, the integration test fails to compile. CI/local workflows should chain build → test.

## Code layout

`programs/fund/src/`:

- `lib.rs` — `declare_id!` and the `#[program] mod fund { ... }` block. Each public program function is a thin delegate to `instructions::<name>::handler`.
- `instructions/` + `instructions.rs` — one file per instruction; the parent module re-exports with `pub use <name>::*` so `Initialize` (account context) and `handler` are reachable as `fund::Initialize` / `fund::initialize::handler`.
- `state.rs` — account state structs (currently empty).
- `constants.rs`, `error.rs` — shared constants and `#[error_code]` enums.

When adding a new instruction:

1. Create `programs/fund/src/instructions/<name>.rs` with `#[derive(Accounts)] pub struct <Name>` and `pub fn handler(...)`.
2. Add `pub mod <name>; pub use <name>::*;` to `instructions.rs`.
3. Add a thin wrapper inside `#[program] mod fund` in `lib.rs` that calls `<name>::handler(ctx, ...)`.

## Wallet / cluster

`Anchor.toml` points provider at `localnet` with wallet `~/.config/solana/id.json`. `litesvm` tests don't touch this — only `anchor deploy` / `anchor migrate` / on-chain interactions do.

## Security

Every new instruction must be reviewed against the Solana/Anchor attack catalogue in @docs/sealevel-attacks.md before merging. Treat the checklist at the bottom of that document as a hard gate — each `#[derive(Accounts)]` struct should be walked through it explicitly.
